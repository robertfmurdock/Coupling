This is a web application that will automatically assign pairs.

The latest build is currently hosted at https://coupling.zegreatrob.com. Please note that because the app is currently
still developing, there's no guarentee that information stored there currently won't be lost during the course of
development (though if it is, that will certainly not be intentional).

Intended to make it quick and easy to pair off, and encourage people to pair with people who they haven't paired with in
a while.

Have fun!

What is Pairing?
----------------

Pairing is the act of two specialists in one profession working together on the same task concurrently. This allows for
constant collaboration when brainstorming for solutions, reinforcement of standards and cultural norms, and immediate
peer-review of all work being produced. This helps build trust that all the content created by the pair is valuable and
safe.

Why Should Pairs Be Rotated?
----------------------------

For better or for worse, teams are made up of people, and people have different skill levels, opinions, temperments and
philosophies. Rotating pairs is intended to help make sure that senior people will get to synchronize with other senior
people periodically. Similarly, junior team members should get the opportunity to work with other junior team members -
this gives them the opportunity to test their growth. Regular rotation of pairs also helps discourage project knowledge
from being reserved for a few 'smart' individuals... at the very least, many team members should see and participate in
decisions regularly.

What Makes For Good Pairing? What Doesn't?
------------------------------------------

As a great man once said, be excellent to one another.


How Does Coupling Choose Pairs?
-------------------------------

Coupling remembers the history of every pair its ever made. The longer you use it, the more it knows! This is important,
because Coupling follows these rules:

1. Whoever has not paired together for the longest time will be automatically paired together.
2. When there are multiple potential pairs that have been apart for the longest time, one is chosen at random. Rules
   continue as normal with the remaining players.

Those rules are repeated until there are no players remaining to be paired together. This encourages teams to let
everybody work together, and that helps build relationships among team members. The best way to learn how to work
together is to actually, directly work together.

Oh no! Someone is sick this week! What should I do?
---------------------------------------------------

Fret not! Coupling is prepared to deal with your problem. When you know someone won't be available for a whole pairing
cycle, tap on their face in the Player Roster (at the bottom of the screen) before spinning for new pairs. They'll be
excluded from this week's roster and Coupling will automatically compensate for their absence.

If someone is only available for part of a pairing cycle, Coupling recommends that you pair them anyway, possibly using
the drag-and-drop manual override to pair them with someone similarly partially available. Part-time pairing with
someone is better then not pairing with them at all!

How Does my Party or Player Card Get One of Those Fancy Pictures?
--------------------------------------------------------

There are multiple options! If you already have the images you want hosted somewhere, you can enter the URL to the image
in the 'Image URL' field for your party or player. If you don't have hosting, you can associate a tribe or player with
an email address and connect it to [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com), and [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com) will
provide your icon.


I Don't Have a Real Team, But I Still Want To Try Coupling!
-----------------------------------------------------------

For people who just want to play with the program and understand its features, try making a party, adding a few players,
and just giving it a shot. :-). https://coupling.zegreatrob.com if you need the link again.

Is This Really Just For Work?
-----------------------------

Nope! Feel free to use this for anything - field trips and buddy systems, pairing up for murder mysteries, impromptu
fight clubs... All I ask is that you send me a nice note telling me about your innovative use of the program.

Good luck!
