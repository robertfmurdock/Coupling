  long_description: "Coupling helps your team pair, by making it big and visible who's working with whom, as well as showing how long its been since specific people have worked together.\r

    \r

    This Slack integration will push that information into a channel of your choice. It updates as you make adjustments, and will even remove invalid entries when you delete them.\r

    \r

    If you like to pair, try it out!"
