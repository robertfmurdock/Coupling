Hey ya. Hey-ey ey ya.

Couple tweaks recently - it came to my attention that the microsoft social integration wasn't working anymore, so I checked up on it and it appears that the secret expired in June.

I'm so sorry if this affected you! I've taken a pass at restoring it to some extent, but it looks like some of the Microsoft tenancy rules have changed, which historically is _annoying_.

As an alternative, I've swapped over to "passwordless" authentication from the previous username/password login. If you can't get access to something because of the Microsoft issues, you should be able to get in using the same email address (as long as you still have access to the email, natch). 

Can't emphasize enough, if you have a problem, clue me in! Open an issue on [github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling), or send me a note.

Stay cooler than cool,
