Hey! What's happening? How are *you*?

*waits patiently for answer, pretending to listen.*

Whoa, I'm happy for you. Or sorry that happened.

Anyway, I've finally crunched the numbers for Coupling in 2022. If you're curious how the world-o-coupling is doing, I've posted the update [here](https://www.zegreatrob.com/2023/05/30/Grow-Together-2022.html).

Thank you, yes you, you-in-particular, for using the app. It doesn't make me any money, but it does bring me joy, and I hope it makes your lives easier.

As always: got a problem? Yo, I'll consider it! Open an issue on [github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling) and let the dj revolve (prioritize?) it.

Have a hot-dev-summer ðŸŒž,
