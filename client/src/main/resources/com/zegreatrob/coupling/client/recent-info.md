Hey all!

I just posted a write-up of all the changes I made to Coupling in 2022. There's a lot! You can read it here: [https://robertfmurdock.github.io/2022/01/10/Grow-Together,-2021.html](https://robertfmurdock.github.io/2022/01/10/Grow-Together,-2021.html)

Most recently, I switched the Auth0 client style, so you may have had to log in again. Sorry about that! Hopefully it wasn't too much of a hiccup.

That's basically all I have to say! Ta for now.

Remember, if anything is acting goofy for you, just open an issue at [the github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling).

Live long and prosper,

- RoB
