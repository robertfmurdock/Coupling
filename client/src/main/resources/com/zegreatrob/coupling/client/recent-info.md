Yo yo yo. Yo.

I just made a small change, after many long years, to Coupling.

We're going to try the word "party" instead of the word "tribe" for the moment. See how it feels. If it vibes with everyone well enough, we'll make the change permanent (at the moment, it is merely surface-level).

So if you have feelings about it, let me know! Open an issue on [github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling), or send me a note.

Keep on keeping on,
