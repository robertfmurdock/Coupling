Salutations!

So I've spent a little time this summer working on a new thing - Slack integration for Coupling. It was more annoying to get setup than one would expect and hope, but I do have a version that people can try if they're interested.

If you want to give it a shot, click on this [link](/incubating) and hit the "Add to Slack" button. And definitely, definitely let me know about any problems or feedback related to it - open an [issue](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling/issues), or just contact me by email, I'd love to hear from you.

Also, I'm considering adding a new payment tier that will allow access to features *like* the Slack integration. Stuff that requires more time to develop. So it is possible - possible I say - that the Slack integration may go behind this paywall at some point.

But! Anyone who tries the Slack feature out now to help me prove its functionality, I'll make sure to grandfather in. And rest assured, none of the current Coupling feature set will disappear - pairs, pins, stats, call-signs... they ain't going NO-where.

Feedback and concerns about this are also appreciated! I don't want to freak anyone out, so I'm breaking the ice here.

Come together, right now, over me,
