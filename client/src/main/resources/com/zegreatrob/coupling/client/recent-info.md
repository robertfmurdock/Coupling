Hey all! We made it to 2021! Coupling just switched from the legacy Kotlin JS compiler to the new IR compiler, so while everything *seems* to be working, let me know if you see anything funky -open an issue at [the github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling).

I hope all in your worlds is healthy and good.
