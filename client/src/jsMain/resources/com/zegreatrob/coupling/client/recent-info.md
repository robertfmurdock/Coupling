Oo rah!

Wow I took a long time to update recent news.

Hi!

Just a reminder, if you want to try the Slack integration, please do! Its working super-well now. I've been using it on my team personally for the last five months and it's been just swanky.

To use it, click on this [link](/incubating) and hit the "Add to Slack" button.

And if you have any trouble getting it set up, let me know!

I just put out a new year-in-review for Coupling over on [www.zegreatrob.com](https://www.zegreatrob.com/blog.html).

Check it out if you're curious what's been up!

Nothing else to report here for now. Just that I appreciate your continued use.

May all of your work be successful and valuable.
