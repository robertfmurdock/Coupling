2025! What a year its been already. HOOO-EEEEE. Enough about that.

I just put together a write-up for Coupling in 2024 over at my blog: https://www.zegreatrob.com/blog.html

That includes the normal "how've ya'll been using the app" notes and numbers.

I'm hoping to enable more features soon, so watch this space if that makes you curious!

I'm still at your service over at rob@continuousexcellence.io, and also generally at GitHub. I appreciate all correspondence!

Have a great spring!
