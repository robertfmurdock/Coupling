# Want to get started with Contributions?

Coupling has the ability to track how often your party members contribute to your project! With this information, your party can be better informed as to what's been happening to the team over time.

## What are Contributions?

In Coupling, a contribution is any meaningful change that's been integrated into your project. Contributions can have properties like:

- All the people who participated in creating the contribution
- When the contribution was integrated
- When the contribution was started
- Its "semantic versioning" increment
- The amount of cycle time the contribution took
- How much joy the team got from making the contribution (see [Measuring Joy for Software Developers](https://www.scrumexpert.com/knowledge/measuring-joy-for-software-developers/))
- And more!

## What does tracking Contributions get me?

You can learn things like:

- How frequently each individual pairs/mob integrates their contributions
- How much cycle time your team averages per contribution
- How much cycle time each pair averages per contribution
- Which eras have flurries of activity vs which ones are slow
- How you feel about statistics (you might like them!)

## Cool! I'm sold. How do I start?

## First: Decide when to make a Contribution official 

Every team and project is different, and your needs might be different than other teams. For software teams, here are some reasonable alternatives as to when you might call it a "contribution":

- Immediately on commit and push to a remote "main" branch
- Only after Github Actions successfully builds a "main" branch
- Only when a PR is merged to a "main" branch

Whatever you choose, you'll want to ensure that you have the ability to run a program on your choice of trigger.

For many of us, that'll mean finding the right part of a "Github Action" / "Azure Dev Ops" / "Jenkins" / Build Server script.
